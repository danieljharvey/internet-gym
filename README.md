# Internet Gym

### Huge annoying signup form

So a few years ago I bought the domain Internet Gym because I figured that would somehow turn into profit, and I never really worked out what I wanted to do with it. Anyway, I realised what the site should be, and what the  world really needs, is a giant never ending incredibly frustrating sign up form with loads of really fussy validation so I thought "this is a good opportunity to try using a language that is incredibly frustrating because of it's fussy validation" so here we are.

Jokes aside though, Pux is nice, this is fun, learning is OK, etc.

### How to get it working because I'm sure you give a shit about that

Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/danieljharvey/internet-gym`

Enter the vortex: `cd internet-gym`

Upgrade your sword: `yarn install`

Reticulate splines: `yarn start`

Licence: MIT or whatever, if you go near this nonsense it's your loss to be honest.
